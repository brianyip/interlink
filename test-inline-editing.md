# Test Plan for Inline Editing Fix

## Expected Behavior
1. Double-click on a cell to enter edit mode
2. Type characters - editing should continue without automatic save
3. `handleSave` should ONLY be called when:
   - Enter key is pressed
   - Click outside the editing cell
   - Click on another editable cell

## Debug Logging
The following console logs should help identify the issue:
- `🔥 handleSave called` - When handleSave is triggered
- `🖱️ handleDocumentClick triggered` - When document click handler fires  
- `🔍 Document click analysis` - Details about the click event
- `✅ Click is inside current editing cell` - When click is inside editing cell
- `🔄 Click is on another editable cell` - When switching to another cell
- `🚪 Click is outside` - When clicking outside
- `✏️ Input onChange` - When typing in input field
- `⌨️ Key pressed` - When pressing keys in input
- `🎯 Setting up document click listener` - When event listener is added/removed

## Test Steps
1. Open http://localhost:3002/dashboard
2. Log in if needed
3. Double-click on any cell to start editing
4. Type a few characters
5. Check console logs - should see onChange events but NO handleSave calls until you press Enter or click outside

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by:
1. **Dependency cascade**: `handleSave` depended on `editingCell`, so it was recreated on every render
2. **Circular dependencies**: `handleDocumentClick` depended on `handleSave`, causing useEffect to re-run frequently
3. **Event bubbling**: Input events might have been bubbling up to document level

## Fix Applied
1. **Used refs for stable values**: `editingCellRef`, `onUpdateRef` to avoid dependency cascades
2. **Made handlers stable**: Empty dependency arrays where possible
3. **Added event stoppers**: Prevent input events from bubbling to document
4. **Enhanced debug logging**: Track exactly when and why handleSave is called
