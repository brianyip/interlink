# Inline Editing Refactor - Option 3 Complete Implementation

## What We Changed

### Removed Document-Level Event Listeners
- **Before**: Used `document.addEventListener('mousedown')` to detect clicks outside
- **After**: Using React's `onBlur` event with `relatedTarget` checks

### Self-Contained EditableCell Component
- Each cell manages its own editing state
- No shared refs or complex state synchronization
- Clean separation of concerns

### Key Implementation Details

1. **Focus Management**:
   - When entering edit mode, input is focused and text is selected
   - Uses `onBlur` to detect when focus leaves the cell
   - Checks `event.relatedTarget` to see if focus moved to another editable cell

2. **Event Handling**:
   - Enter key: Save changes
   - Escape key: Cancel changes
   - Click outside: Save changes (via onBlur)
   - Click on another cell: Save current, start editing new cell

3. **State Management**:
   - Each EditableCell has its own `isEditing` and `editValue` state
   - No complex ref tracking or state synchronization needed

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: Much cleaner code without document listeners
2. **Reliability**: No timing issues or event conflicts
3. **Performance**: Better performance without global event listeners
4. **Maintainability**: Self-contained components are easier to understand

## How It Works

1. Double-click a cell to enter edit mode
2. Type continuously without interruption
3. Save by pressing Enter or clicking outside
4. Cancel by pressing Escape
5. Click another cell to save current and edit the new one

## Test the Implementation

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/links
2. Double-click any cell
3. Type multiple characters - editing should continue
4. Press Enter to save or Escape to cancel
5. Click outside to save changes
